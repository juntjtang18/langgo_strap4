16	A Cosmopolite in a Café	O. Henry	In a bustling midnight café, the narrator encounters E. Rushmore Coglan, a self-proclaimed cosmopolite, who engages in a deep conversation about the true essence of being a cosmopolitan. Coglan defines a cosmopolite as someone who feels at home everywhere, without ties to any specific location, and maintains an indifference to their surroundings. The discussion, filled with philosophical insights and personal anecdotes, stretches into the early morning, leaving the narrator intrigued by Coglan's perspective. As they part ways, Coglan heads off to his next engagement, exemplifying his cosmopolitan lifestyle.	At midnight the café was crowded. By some chance the little table at which I sat had escaped the eye of incomers, and two vacant chairs at it extended their arms with venal hospitality to the influx of patrons.\n\nAnd then a cosmopolite sat in one of them, and I was glad, for I held a theory that since Adam no true citizen of the world has existed. We hear of them, and we see foreign labels on much luggage, but we find travellers instead of cosmopolites.\n\nI invoke your consideration of the scene—the marble-topped tables, the range of leather-upholstered wall seats, the gay company, the ladies dressed in demi-state toilets, speaking in an exquisite visible chorus of taste, economy, opulence or art; the seductive outpouring of light and wine, the dim suggestions of stately retinues and princely chambers conveyed by that most romantic of fruits, the great, pyriform, melting, and luscious pear. The cosmopolite was named E. Rushmore Coglan, and he will be heard from next summer at Coney Island. It was not past eleven when he came in, and he apologized for being late, explaining that he had been detained by a poker game at a friend's house. His voice was as intimate as the rustle of sheets, and he dropped easily into a chair by my side, and, filling his glass from my bottle, won his way artfully into my liking with flattering comments upon the brand of my wine and a disagreeable story about two judges who had stolen a goose from a widow in New Jersey.\n\nAs we talked we discussed many subjects, moving easily from topic to topic, but always returning to the question of cosmopolitanism, a theme which seemed to possess Mr. Coglan with a peculiar charm and fascination.\n\n"Now, to settle once for all," he said, animatedly, "let us define our terms. What is your idea of a cosmopolite, Mr. Arden?"\n\nI said something about the Brotherhood of Man, a subject upon which I am wont to be eloquent.\n\n"Exactly," said Coglan, interrupting, "but that is not it. The true cosmopolite will go much further than that. You want to know what my definition of a cosmopolite is; it's this: one who is at home even in places where he finds himself most foreign. That is my definition."\n\n"Interesting," I said. "But it strikes me that a genuine cosmopolite must be a citizen of the world without a permanent address. Don't you think so?"\n\n"My dear sir," said Coglan, with heat, "you are right, per se. But your mistake lies in your failure to note the second qualification necessary to the existence of the true cosmopolite. And that qualification is unconcern. He must be absolutely indifferent to where he is, and with whom he is. The moment he begins to make comparisons, to contrast the foreign with the familiar, he has lost his savor. He is as much out of place as a violin at a hoedown. For instance, I am in New York; but I am not a New Yorker. I am here today and gone tomorrow. Chance has brought me here; necessity will take me away. I am a cosmopolite. I make Rome my home or else wander to the farthest Indies. Another glass of this excellent claret!"\n\nTogether we finished the bottle, and called for another. Even the cosmopolite's enthusiasm for his theory did not make him monotonous. To-night he was more interesting than I had ever found him—he enlarged upon his theme.\n\n"Think of the thousands and thousands of persons," he said, "who have lived and died, who never knew the delights of a blue-point oyster. They have never heard of such a thing. Millions of them have never seen a monkey-wrench or a locomotive. They are dead and gone without ever having had a chance to see the world. What would you call them?"\n\n"I should call them unfortunate," I answered, "but not necessarily non-cosmopolites."\n\n"You are wrong," said Coglan, warmly. "They were the true cosmopolites. What is it to see the world? Nothing. But to be a cosmopolite is everything."\n\nHis ideas attracted me. We sat talking until daylight, and as I listened, I began to feel more and more that there was much reason in what he said, so much that I had not the heart to argue with him.\n\nFinally, he stood up, and reached for his coat.\n\n"Where are you off to now?" I asked.\n\n"To meet the 7:15 train," he said. "I have an engagement at Westbury at 8:30."\n\n"And you are going to walk?" I exclaimed.\n\n"Sure," he replied. "It's only six miles. Good exercise. Good morning."\n\nI watched him as he stepped briskly down the street. Yes, he was a cosmopolite—a citizen of the world.	\N	\N	795	2025-07-20 13:36:03.994	2025-08-14 00:10:31.553	\N	1	en	1
8	A Retrieved Reformation	O. Henry	Jimmy Valentine, a skilled safecracker, is released from prison with a pardon from the governor after serving ten months of a four-year sentence. Despite the warden's advice to reform, Jimmy immediately returns to his criminal activities, retrieving his specialized burglary tools from a hidden location. He resumes his life of crime under the guise of a respectable businessman, committing several successful burglaries. However, his past catches up to him as detective Ben Price begins to track his movements, recognizing the unique methods used in the recent burglaries. Jimmy's life takes an unexpected turn when he arrives in Elmore, Arkansas, and encounters Annabel Adams, a young lady whose presence challenges his criminal identity.	A guard came to the prison shoe-shop, where Jimmy Valentine was assiduously stitching uppers, and escorted him to the front office. There the warden handed Jimmy his pardon, which had been signed that morning by the governor. Jimmy took it in a tired kind of way. He had served nearly ten months of a four-year sentence. He had expected to stay only about three months, at the longest. When a man with as many friends on the outside as Jimmy Valentine had is received in the "stir" it is hardly worth while to cut his hair.\n\n"Now, Valentine," said the warden, "you'll go out in the morning. Brace up, and make a man of yourself. You're not a bad fellow at heart. Stop cracking safes, and live straight."\n\n"Me?" said Jimmy, in surprise. "Why, I never cracked a safe in my life."\n\n"Oh, no," laughed the warden. "Of course not. Let's see, now. How was it you happened to get sent up on that Springfield job? Was it because you wouldn't prove an alibi for fear of compromising somebody in extremely high-toned society? Or was it simply a case of a mean old jury that had it in for you? It's always one or the other with you innocent victims."\n\n"Me?" said Jimmy, still blankly virtuous. "Why, warden, I never was in Springfield in my life!"\n\n"Take him back, Cronin!" said the warden, "and fix him up with outgoing clothes. Unlock him at seven in the morning, and let him come to the bull-pen. Better think over my advice, Valentine."\n\nAt a quarter past seven on the next morning Jimmy stood in the warden's outer office. He had on a suit of the villainously fitting, ready-made clothes and a pair of the stiff, squeaky shoes that the state furnishes to its discharged compulsory guests. The clerk handed him a railroad ticket and the five-dollar bill with which the law expected him to rehabilitate himself into good citizenship and prosperity. The warden gave him a cigar, and shook hands. Valentine, 9762, was chronicled on the books "Pardoned by the Governor," and Mr. James Valentine walked out into the sunshine.\n\nDisregarding the song of the birds, the waving green trees, and the smell of the flowers, Jimmy headed straight for a restaurant. There he tasted the first sweet joys of liberty in the shape of a broiled chicken and a bottle of white wine---followed by a cigar a grade better than the one the warden had given him. From there he proceeded leisurely to the depot. He tossed a quarter into the hat of a blind man sitting by the door, and boarded his train. Three hours set him down in a little town near the state line. He went to the café of one Mike Dolan and shook hands with Mike, who was alone behind the bar.\n\n"Sorry we couldn't make it sooner, Jimmy, me boy," said Mike. "But we had that protest from Springfield to buck against, and the governor nearly balked. Feeling all right?"\n\n"Fine," said Jimmy. "Got my key?"\n\nHe got his key and went upstairs, unlocking the door of a room at the rear. Everything was just as he had left it. There on the floor was still Ben Price's collar-button that had been torn from that eminent detective's shirt-band when they had overpowered Jimmy to arrest him.\n\nPulling out from the wall a folding-bed, Jimmy slid back a panel in the wall and dragged out a dust-covered suitcase. He opened this and gazed fondly at the finest set of burglar's tools in the East. It was a complete set, made of specially tempered steel, the latest designs in drills, punches, braces and bits, jimmies, clamps, and augers, with two or three novelties invented by Jimmy himself, in which he took pride. Over nine hundred dollars they had cost him to have made at --- a place where they make such things for the profession.\n\nIn half an hour Jimmy went downstairs and through the café. He was now dressed in tasteful and well-fitting clothes, and carried his dusted and cleaned suitcase in his hand.\n\n"Got anything on?" asked Mike Dolan, genially.\n\n"Me?" said Jimmy, in a puzzled tone. "I don't understand. I'm representing the New York Amalgamated Short Snap Biscuit Cracker and Fraction Company."\n\nThis statement delighted Mike to such an extent that Jimmy had to take a seltzer-and-milk on the spot. He never touched "hard" drinks.\n\nA week after the release of Valentine, 9762, there was a neat job of safe-burglary done in Richmond, Indiana, with no clue to the author. A scant eight hundred dollars was all that was secured. Two weeks after that a patented, improved, burglar-proof safe in Logan sport was opened like a cheese to the tune of fifteen hundred dollars, currency; securities and silver untouched. That began to interest the rogue-catchers. Then an old-fashioned bank-safe in Jefferson City became active and threw out of its crater an eruption of bank-notes amounting to five thousand dollars. The losses were now high enough to bring the matter up into Ben Price's class of work. By comparing notes, a remarkable similarity in the methods of the burglaries was noticed. Ben Price investigated the scenes of the robberies, and was heard to remark:\n\n"That's Dandy Jim Valentine's autograph. He's resumed business. Look at that combination knob---jerked out as easy as pulling up a radish in wet weather. He's got the only clamps that can do it. And look how clean those tumblers were punched out! Jimmy never has to drill but one hole. Yes, I guess I want Mr. Valentine. He'll do his bit next time without any short-time or clemency foolishness."\n\nBen Price knew Jimmy's habits. He had learned them while working up the Springfield case. Long jumps, quick getaways, no confederates, and a taste for good society---these ways had helped Mr. Valentine to become noted as a successful dodger of retribution. It was given out that Ben Price had taken up the trail of the elusive cracksman, and other people with burglar-proof safes felt more at ease.\n\nOne afternoon Jimmy Valentine and his suitcase climbed out of the mail-hack in Elmore, a little town five miles off the railroad down in the black-jack country of Arkansas. Jimmy, looking like an athletic young senior just home from college, went down the board side-walk toward the hotel.\n\nA young lady crossed the street, passed him at the corner, and entered a door over which was the sign "The Elmore Bank." Jimmy Valentine looked into her eyes, forgot what he was, and became another man. She lowered her eyes and coloured slightly. Young men of Jimmy's style and looks were scarce in Elmore.\n\nJimmy collared a boy that was loafing on the steps of the bank as if he were one of the stockholders, and began to ask him questions about the town, feeding him dimes at intervals. By and by the young lady came out, looking royally unconscious of the young man with the suitcase, and went her way.\n\n"Naw," said the boy, "she's Annabel Adams. Her pa owns this bank. What'd you come to Elmore for? Is that a gold watch-chain? I'm going to get a bulldog. Got any more dimes?"\n\nJimmy went to the Planters' Hotel, registered as Ralph D. Spencer, and engaged a room. He leaned on the desk and declared his platform to the clerk. He said he had come to Elmore to look for a location to go into business. How was the shoe-business, now, in the town? He had thought of the shoe-business. Was there an opening?\n\nThe clerk was impressed by the clothes and manner of Jimmy. He himself was something of a pattern of fashion to the thinly gilded youth of Elmore, but he now perceived his shortcomings. While trying to figure out Jimmy's manner of tying his fourin-hand he cordially gave information.\n\nYes, there ought to be a good opening in the shoe line. There wasn't an exclusive shoe-store in the place. The dry-goods and general stores handled them. Business in all lines was fairly good. Hoped Mr. Spencer would decide to locate in Elmore. He would find it a pleasant town to live in, and the people very sociable.\n\nMr. Spencer thought he would stop over in the town a few days and look over the situation. No, the clerk needn't call the boy. He would carry up his suitcase, himself; it was rather heavy.\n\nMr. Ralph Spencer, the phoenix that arose from Jimmy Valentine's ashes---ashes left by the flame of a sudden and alterative attack of love---remained in Elmore, and prospered. He opened a shoe-store and secured a good run of trade.\n\nSocially he was also a success, and made many friends. And he accomplished the wish of his heart. He met Miss Annabel Adams, and became more and more capt...	\N	\N	1478	2025-07-20 12:06:33.803	2025-08-05 23:58:27.017	\N	1	en	1
11	A Chaparral Christmas Gift	O. Henry	Set in the evolving ranching community of Los Pinos, the story contrasts the changing values between generations of settlers. The original settlers were fighters who claimed the land through conflict, while their descendants, more settled and less combative, enclosed their lands with wire fences, symbolizing a shift from conquest to cultivation. The narrative focuses on old Ramon Torres, the current owner of a large ranch, who is humorously confronted with offers to buy more wire fencing, despite his visible disdain for it. His interactions with a young salesman and Rosita, a neighboring rancher's daughter, lead to a reconsideration of the fences' impact on community and landscape. The story culminates in a decision that reconnects the community, reflecting a blend of old values and new realities.	The original first settlers of Los Pinos had been men of the vicarious, or fighting, class. They were of the opinion that the earth belonged to them and to whatsoever posterity they might beget. Time, with his innumerable sleight-of-hand tricks, had never taught them that the earth invariably wins the game.\n\nThe sons of the pioneers were a different breed. Their fathers had fought for the land, and had won it. The sons built wire fences around it, and ploughed it, and increased its value. But the fighting edge had been blunted in the pioneers' sons.\n\nLos Pinos was now a ranch of a thousand acres, owned by one man. The house in which he lived was built of adobe, low, with a wide veranda, and a garden of semitropic plants and shrubs. But from the rear one could look out upon a broad expanse of lesser ranches and see at a glance the outward changes that had come with the second generation.\n\nAmong other innovations the wire fence had been introduced. This was a grievance so bitter that it extended back from the second generation to the first. The old men riding by stopped to rail at it; they lashed their horses with their quirts when they were forced to turn and detour around its insurmountable stretches. They attacked it with knives and pistols, mutilating it, and filling its interstices with vain bullets and impotent curses.\n\nOne afternoon a young man rode through the old, weather-beaten gate of Los Pinos, and dismounted at the door of the ranch house. He was dressed in the garb of the cowpuncher, and seemed to find some difficulty in making his errand known. Old Ramon Torres, owner of Los Pinos, came out to him, chewing a straw, and exhibiting a polite interest.\n\n"I was riding by," said the young man, hesitatingly, "and I thought I'd stop in. Maybe you might want to buy some good wire fencing. I've got a sample here in my pocket."\n\nOld Ramon plucked the straw from his mouth, and his jaws ceased to masticate.\n\n"Wire fencing!" he shouted, with a sudden, grim humour. "Wire fencing! And you stop at Los Pinos with it! Wire fencing!"\n\nHe threw his head back, and laughed harshly and loudly.\n\n"Come here, sir," he said, finally, controlling his mirth. "Step this way, if you please."\n\nHe led the way to the rear of the house, and pointed to a stretch of landscape amply provided with wire fencing.\n\n"Look at that," he said, waving his hand. "Wire fencing! And you come here to sell me wire fencing! My friend, excuse these tears."\n\nHe walked to the corner of the house, and bestowed a kick upon a saddle that lay there, overturning it.\n\n"Wire fencing!" he muttered, as he walked back to the young man.\n\nThe young man had turned a little pale.\n\n"I didn't know," he said, "that you had so much already. I thought maybe you might want some more."\n\n"More!" shouted old Ramon. "More wire fencing! Look here, sir."\n\nHe took the young man by the arm, and led him to the end of the porch.\n\n"You see that enclosure?" he asked. "Well, that's where I keep my dogs. And do you know what I'm going to do with those dogs some day? I'm going to turn them loose along the road, and the first man that comes along trying to sell me wire fencing, I'm going to set the dogs on him. Wire fencing!"\n\nThe young man mounted his horse and rode away.\n\nOld Ramon sat down on the porch, and laughed until he cried.\n\nAnd then, suddenly, he ceased laughing, and his face grew grave.\n\nHe had seen a little cloud of dust rising far down the road. He knew it was the sign of a rider, and he waited, watching it with narrowed eyes.\n\nThe rider came on, became more distinct, and now he was near enough for Ramon to see that it was a woman who rode. She was young, and rode astride, and managed her horse with ease and grace. Ramon knew her well. It was Rosita, the daughter of old man Garcia, who owned the next ranch. Now, what could Rosita be coming to Los Pinos for?\n\nAs she drew near, Ramon went down to the gate to meet her.\n\n"Good-day, Señorita," he said, lifting his hat. "And what brings you to Los Pinos?"\n\n"I came," said Rosita, looking at him with her big, dark eyes, "to see if you had any wire fencing to sell."\n\nRamon felt for the moment as if the earth were giving way beneath his feet.\n\n"Wire fencing!" he gasped.\n\n"Yes," said Rosita, smiling. "We are needing some at our ranch, and I thought, perhaps, you might have some to spare."\n\nRamon recovered himself, and bowed.\n\n"I shall be most happy," he said, "to let you have all that you need. But come in, Señorita, and rest yourself. You must be tired after your ride."\n\nRosita dismounted, and Ramon led her horse away to the stable. When he returned, he found her seated on the porch, fanning herself with her sombrero.\n\nRamon sat down beside her, and they began to talk. And as they talked, Ramon's eyes were often upon the wire fencing, and he thought deeply.\n\nAnd by and by he said:\n\n"Señorita, it is true that I have much wire fencing, as you see. But I have been thinking that perhaps it would be better to do away with it altogether. It is ugly, and it mars the beauty of the landscape. And it is not hospitable, or neighbourly. What do you think, Señorita?"\n\n"I think," said Rosita, slowly, "that it would be a good idea."\n\nAnd so it came about that the wire fencing at Los Pinos was gradually removed, and the old, hospitable, neighbourly life of the ranch was resumed. And in time, Rosita came to be the mistress of Los Pinos, and brought with her the gentleness and the grace that had been somewhat lacking.\n\nAnd old Ramon was content. He had lost his wire fencing, but he had gained something better. And sometimes, when he saw the young men and the young women riding together, and heard their laughter and their happy voices, he would say to himself that the old times were not so bad, after all.\n\nAnd the wire fencing was never missed.	\N	\N	1070	2025-07-20 13:02:34.792	2025-08-06 12:01:09.048	\N	1	en	\N
13	The Last Leaf	O. Henry	In a quaint district near Washington Square, two artist friends, Johnsy and Sue, share a studio in a lively artist community. The story unfolds in late autumn as Johnsy battles pneumonia, convinced her fate is tied to the ivy leaves falling outside her window. She believes she will die when the last leaf falls. Sue, desperate to save her friend, tries to distract her and instill hope. Amidst this poignant vigil, the narrative explores themes of friendship, hope, and the power of art.	In a little district west of Washington Square the streets have run crazy and broken themselves into small strips called "places." These "places" make strange angles and curves. One Street crosses itself a time or two. An artist once discovered a valuable possibility in this street. Suppose he should paint a picture of Madison Square Garden on a wet night. But no, the public would not have it. It was too easy; they could not understand his work.\n\nThe painter had been living in a three-story brick house. The house was more than a studio. It was an art club, a meeting place for those who loved art. Johnsy and Sue were friends who lived in the top flat of the house. Johnsy was familiar for Joanna. Sue was familiar for Susan. They had met at the table d'hote of an Eighth Street "Delmonico's," and found their tastes in art, chicory salad and bishop sleeves so congenial that the joint studio resulted.\n\nThat was in May. In November a cold, unseen stranger, whom the doctors called Pneumonia, stalked about the colony, touching one here and there with his icy fingers. Over on the east side this ravager strode boldly, smiting his victims by scores, but his feet trod slowly through the maze of the narrow and moss-grown "places."\n\nJohnsy lay, scarcely making a ripple under the bedclothes, with her face toward the window. Sue, who had been trained as a nurse in her hometown, had many opportunities to practice her profession since Johnsy fell ill. The doctor had been in to see his patient that day and had said that she had a fighting chance if she wanted to live.\n\n"She has one chance in—let us say, ten," he had said, as he shook down the mercury in his clinical thermometer. "And that chance is for her to want to live. This way people have of lining-up on the side of the gravedigger makes the entire pharmacopoeia look silly. Your little lady has made up her mind that she's not going to get well. Has she anything on her mind?"\n\n"She—she wanted to paint the Bay of Naples some day," said Sue.\n\n"Paint?—bosh! Has she anything on her mind worth thinking twice—a man for instance?"\n\n"A man?" said Sue, with a jew's-harp twang in her voice. "Is a man worth—but, no, doctor; there is nothing of the kind."\n\n"Well, it is the weakness, then," said the doctor. "I will do all that science, so far as it may filter through my efforts, can accomplish. But whenever my patient begins to count the carriages in her funeral procession I subtract 50 per cent from the curative power of medicines. If you will get her to ask one question about the new winter styles in cloak sleeves I will promise you a one-fifth of a chance for her, instead of one-tenth."\n\nWhen the doctor had gone Sue went into the workroom and cried a Japanese napkin to a pulp. Then she swaggered into Johnsy's room with her drawing board, whistling ragtime.\n\nJohnsy lay with her face toward the window. Sue stopped whistling, thinking she was asleep.\n\nShe arranged her board and began a pen-and-ink drawing to illustrate a magazine story. Young artists must pave their way to Art by drawing pictures for magazine stories that young authors write to pave their way to Literature.\n\nAs Sue was sketching a pair of elegant horse-show riding trousers and a monocle on the figure of the hero, an Idaho cowboy, she heard a low sound, several times repeated. She went quickly to the bedside.\n\nJohnsy's eyes were open wide. She was looking out the window and counting—counting backward.\n\n"Twelve," she said, and a little later "eleven"; and then "ten," and "nine"; and then "eight" and "seven," almost together.\n\nSue looked solicitously out of the window. What was there to count? There was only a bare, dreary yard to be seen, and the blank side of the brick house twenty feet away. An old, old ivy vine, gnarled and decayed at the roots, climbed half way up the brick wall. The cold breath of autumn had stricken its leaves from the vine until its skeleton branches clung, almost bare, to the crumbling bricks.\n\n"What is it, dear?" asked Sue.\n\n"Six," said Johnsy, in almost a whisper. "They're falling faster now. Three days ago there were almost a hundred. It made my head ache to count them. But now it's easy. There goes another one. There are only five left now."\n\n"Five what, dear? Tell your Sudie."\n\n"Leaves. On the ivy vine. When the last one falls I must go, too. I've known that for three days. Didn't the doctor tell you?"\n\n"Oh, I never heard of such nonsense," complained Sue, with magnificent scorn. "What have old ivy leaves to do with your getting well? And you used to love that vine so, you naughty girl. Don't be a goosey. Why, the doctor told me this morning that your chances for getting well real soon were—let's see exactly what he said—he said the chances were ten to one! Why, that's almost as good as a sure thing! And here you are talking about ivy leaves and nonsense."\n\n"I know," said Johnsy, closing her eyes and lying white and still as a fallen statue; "because I know something, Sue. The last leaf stays on the vine, I will not leave this bed alive. I know it. I feel it. If there had been one leaf on when the last one fell I would have gotten well. But if the last one goes, I must go."\n\n"But what have old ivy leaves to do with your getting well? And you used to love that vine."\n\n"I tell you I know," said Johnsy, with eyes wide open. "I've been here for three days. Didn't you wonder why I was so still? I've been waiting for that last leaf to fall. I've watched it every moment. I know I will go with the last one. It's falling now. I'm tired of waiting. I'm tired of thinking. I want to turn loose my hold on everything, and go sailing down, down, just like one of those poor, tired leaves."\n\n"To be sure, I have my own ideas of artistic effect in such matters," said Sue, who was from Maine and had been brought up on codfish and beans. "But I couldn't stand to hear you say such things. You're not going to be silly enough to let a little leaf send you to the graveyard. Come now, I'll draw the curtain, and we'll just imagine that the last leaf has fallen. Then I'll draw you a picture of a nice vine with a thousand leaves on it, all fresh and green."\n\n"I want to see the last one fall before it gets dark. Then I'll go, too," said Johnsy, still looking out the window. "I want to see the last one fall. I'm tired of waiting."\n\n"But, dear," said Sue, "just think of how you used to love that vine. You loved it because it was a part of the view from this window. Now, you know that old vine can't bring you any bad luck."\n\n"I know," said Johnsy, "but it's weak, and it's old, and the storm last night was enough to pull it down. I know it's foolish, but I feel as if I'd go with the last leaf."\n\nSue looked out of the window. What she saw was not of much help to her in her fight for Johnsy's life. There was only one leaf left on the vine. It was a very old and very sickly-looking leaf. It hung bravely from a branch about twenty feet above the ground.\n\n"It is the last one," said Johnsy. "I thought it would surely fall during the night. I heard the wind. It will fall today, and I shall die at the same time."\n\n"Dear, dear!" said Sue, leaning her worn face down to the pillow, "think of me, if you won't think of yourself. What would I do?"\n\nBut Johnsy did not answer. The last leaf was still there.\n\nSue looked out of the window. It was a cold, bare, dreary yard below. But the leaf was still there.\n\nThe ivy leaf was still there.\n\nSue went to the table and brought a drawing board. She had been working on a pen-and-ink drawing that she wanted to finish. The drawing was of an old man with a long beard. His head was covered with a wide-brimmed hat. The old man was looking up at a vine covered with leaves. Sue called the drawing "Behrman's Masterpiece."\n\nShe looked out of the window. The leaf was still there. She went to Johnsy and said, "I have something to tell you, white mouse."\n\nJohnsy lay for a long time looking at her. Then she called her name "Sudie."\n\n"What is it, dear?" Sue asked.\n\n"I've been a bad girl, Sudie," said Johnsy. "Something has made that last leaf stay there to show me how wicked I was. It is a sin to want to die."\n\n"You may be right," said Sue, "in your half-delirious condition."\n\n"No," said Johnsy, with a smile. "I'm not delirious. I've been thinking. I think the last leaf is a message from God. It is wrong to want to die. I will try to eat now. But first bring me a looking glass, so that I can see myself."\n\nAnd then she said, "I want to see the last leaf. Is it still there?"\n\n"Yes," said Sue. "It is still there."\n\n"Then I'm not going to die," said Johnsy, sitting up in bed. "I'll get well. I'll try. And I'll eat. And I'll sleep. And I'll try to be happy."\n\n"You're a good girl," said Sue. "Try to sleep. I'll paint the ivy leaf and put it where you can see it every day. We'll keep it always."\n\n"I want to see the last leaf," said Johnsy. "I want to see it now."\n\nSue took her to the window and pointed out the leaf. "It is the last one," she said. "It is still there."\n\n"I'm so glad," said Johnsy. "I'm so glad."\n\nJohnsy's eyes were open wide. She was looking at the ivy leaf. Then she lay back on her pillow and smiled.\n\n"Something has made that last leaf stay there to show me how wicked I was," she said. "It is a sin to want to die."\n\nSue looked out of the window. The ivy leaf was still there.\n\nThen she went to Behrman's room. Behrman was an old, old artist who lived on the ground floor beneath them. He was past sixty and had a Michael Angelo's Moses beard curling down from the head of a satyr along the body of an imp. Behrman was a failure in art. For forty years he had always been about to paint a masterpiece, but had never yet begun it. He had been always about to paint a masterpiece and had never yet begun it. He was a fierce little old man who scoffed terribly at softness in anyone, and yet he was always ready to befriend young artists and to buy them brandy. He had been always about to paint a masterpiece and had never yet begun it. He scoffed at softness, but he was always ready to befriend young artists and to buy them brandy.\n\nSue found him in his room. He was in his shirt sleeves, with a great smudge of yellow paint on his right arm and a blue smudge on his left. He had been painting for twenty-four hours a day for several days. He had been painting the ivy leaf.\n\n"It is the last one," he said. "It is my masterpiece."\n\nHe was ill only two days. Pneumonia finished what its icy fingers had begun.\n\nAnd the day the last ivy leaf fell, they found him dead on the floor of his room.\n\nAnd then they found a lantern still lighted, and a ladder that had been dragged from its place, and some scattered brushes, and a palette with green and yellow colors mixed on it, and—look out the window, dear, at the last ivy leaf on the wall. Didn't you wonder why it never fluttered or moved when the wind blew? Ah, darling, it's Behrman's masterpiece—he painted it there the night that the last leaf fell.	\N	\N	2075	2025-07-20 13:29:00.7	2025-08-06 11:25:46.689	\N	1	en	\N
9	A Blackjack Bargainer	O. Henry	In the small town of Bethel, nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge, Yancey Goree, a descendant of a once wealthy Virginia family, struggles with his failing law practice and dwindling finances. After his grand home burns down, he relocates to a decrepit brick office, surviving on the meager income from selling parcels of his ancestral land. His fortunes seem to revive slightly when Colonel Abner Coltrane, a respected figure, enters his office with a legal job to foreclose a mortgage on a widow's property, a task that conflicts with Goree's moral values. Torn between his desperate financial situation and his innate sense of chivalry, Goree faces a moral dilemma that challenges his integrity and sense of self.	The most disreputable thing in Yancey Goree's law office was Goree himself, sprawled in his creaky old arm-chair. The rickety little office, built of red brick, was set flush with the street—the main street of the town of Bethel. Bethel rested upon the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge. From the windows of the office, one could see the rugged, gray crags of the mountains looming distinctly against the blue Southern sky. Bethel was a "hum" of considerable importance in the State; her principal industries being the manufacture of cotton and religion. The Court House and the Lord's House lifted their domes high above the other public buildings; and the chimneys of the cotton mills touched the low clouds with fingers grimy with the smoke of labor.\n\nBut the room seemed to deny that it was an office. Books of law there were none. One or two old chairs, a pine table, a wall calendar advertising a patent medicine, and a cast-iron stove from whose isinglass sides flickered the light of a wood fire—these things made up its appointments. On the table lay a few old newspapers, some legal blanks, and an inkstand with a dry sponge in it. The floor was covered with a green carpet, threadbare and ragged. In one corner stood a small safe with the door ajar. The safe was empty, and the door swung open, squeaking dolorously each time the draft moved it.\n\nYancey Goree was a descendant of the Gorees of Virginia. He had inherited the old Goree homestead in Bethel, where, until a few years previous, he had lived in baronial style, entertaining the countryside with a liberal hand. But the old house had burned down, and Yancey had taken to the practice of law to retrieve his fallen fortunes. This he had not accomplished, for Yancey had the besetting weakness of the Gorees, which was to wait for dead men's shoes. He had waited for them so long that his creditors had grown tired of waiting longer themselves.\n\nHis only remaining piece of property was the old brick office, originally built for a warehouse when Bethel had a river trade, and now but little better than a ruin. No clients came to seek professional services. Yancey's friends were not the kind that needed legal advice. They were more apt to seek the back room of Ben Tatum's saloon, which was entered by a side door and contained a "sideboard" and two tables for stud and draw poker.\n\nThe money derived from the occasional sale of a piece of the old Goree land barely paid for his liquor and tobacco. His credit was no longer good at the stores. It was at the lowest ebb of his fortunes that Goree had the luck to make a ten strike—in vulgar parlance. It was what the local newspapers would have called a "romantic episode" had they dared to chronicle it.\n\nOne day Goree was sitting in his office half asleep. He had been on a week's spree at Ben Tatum's, and was drowsing away the aftermath. Suddenly he was aware of a tall, elderly gentleman standing inside the door—a fine figure of a man, with a white mustache and piercing eyes. Goree knew him well. It was Colonel Abner Coltrane, of the town of Laurel, thirty miles away—a lawyer, a planter, a gentleman of the old school, who had never before acknowledged the fallen Yancey by so much as a nod or a lift of the eyebrows.\n\n"Good morning," said Colonel Coltrane, with formal politeness. "I have a matter of business that I hope you can arrange for me."\n\nGoree rose to his feet, leaning heavily upon the table. He was a tall man, heavily built, with a face too intelligent and too spiritual for his surroundings. His eyes were large and mild; his hair was a vehement red; and his clothes were much the worse for wear.\n\n"I hope so, Colonel," he said, with a tremor in his voice. "It would be a pleasure to attend to anything in the line of business you might entrust to me."\n\n"I wish you to foreclose a mortgage on a small piece of property down here," said the Colonel, laying a legal-looking document on the table. "The papers are all drawn. I have only to ask you to attend to the details."\n\nGoree's fingers trembled as he took the paper. His sensations were those of a man who, about to starve, sees food denied him by a locked glass door. Here was business, and he needed it; but the thought of foreclosing on a piece of property was repugnant to him. His extravagant Southern chivalry recoiled at the thought.\n\n"I suppose," he said, hesitatingly, to the Colonel, "that there is no chance for the owner to redeem?"\n\n"I am afraid not," said the Colonel, coldly. "My client is not in a position to trifle with his rights or his legal remedies. The time is up to-morrow. I cannot give the owner any more grace."\n\nGoree sat down and buried his face in his hands. After a while he rose up and shook himself like a great mastiff, and a new light came into his faded eyes.\n\n"It shall be done," he said, firmly. "I will attend to it at once."\n\n"I will send my man around with the money to-morrow," said the Colonel. "And now, Mr. Goree, I will bid you good morning."\n\nWhen the Colonel was gone, Goree took the paper, and ran his eye over it. His practice had been none too lucrative, and he was unfamiliar with the latest laws and decisions. He had been "going to" subscribe to a law journal, but had put it off.\n\nThe property owner was a widow—a Mrs. Ramsey, who lived in a little white cottage some distance down the mountain side. The amount of the mortgage was $400.\n\nGoree put on his hat and walked out into the sunshine. The fresh air revived him. He looked at the mountains thoughtfully. There was a time when he would have ridden fifty miles for the sake of a lady in distress. But that—was long ago. Now, he was hurrying to take from a widow her little all.\n\nHe walked rapidly in the direction of Mrs. Ramsey's cottage. When he reached it, he found her chopping wood in the back yard. She was a frail figure, dressed in a faded calico dress, with a sunbonnet hanging down her back. Her face was thin and worn, and she looked as if she might be ill.\n\n"Good morning, Mrs. Ramsey," said Goree, lifting his hat. "I am sorry to disturb you, but I have a painful duty to perform."\n\nMrs. Ramsey leaned her ax against a tree, and wiped her forehead with the back of a sunburnt hand.\n\n"Lawyer Goree, I reckon it's about that mortgage. I've been expecting you."\n\n"Yes," said Goree, "it is. I must ask you to prepare to vacate. The property must be sold."\n\nThe woman looked at him with a sudden flash of anger in her eyes.\n\n"And you can come here," she said, "and tell me this to my face! My God! have men got no more heart than that? I've worked—oh, how I've worked to keep the home together, and now to have it taken away!"\n\nGoree's face was white. He hated himself for what he was doing.\n\n"I am sorry—more sorry than I can tell you," he said, huskily. "But it is not my wish—it is the law."\n\nThe woman's eyes softened. Goree saw the tears come into them, and he turned his head away.\n\n"I can't help it, Lawyer Goree," she said, "I must say it. It's hard—it's cruel. I had hoped till the last that something would turn up. But I'll go. When must I leave?"\n\n"The sale will take place in three days," said Goree. "I advise you to make arrangements as soon as possible. I must now go back to the office and attend to the necessary details."\n\nHe left her standing by the woodpile, and strode away, with his head high, but with a heart heavy as lead.\n\nAs he walked, he began to think rapidly. By the time he had reached the office, he had made up his mind. He went quickly inside, to the safe, unlocked it, and took out a thin, old-fashioned gold watch. From the back of the watch he pried out with his knife an old daguerreotype of his mother, taken when she was a young girl. He wrapped the picture carefully in a piece of paper, and put it in his pocket. Then he closed the safe, and went out again into the street.\n\nHe went straight to Ben Tatum's saloon. He found Ben at his favorite occupation of dozing behind the bar.\n\n"Hello, Yancey," said Ben, drowsily. "What's new?"\n\n"I want to see you, Ben," said Goree, seriously. "I want to talk to you about a business matter."\n\n"All right," said Ben, becoming instantly alert. "Come into the back room."\n\nWhen they were seated at the table, Goree began, without preamble:\n\n"Ben, I want to raise some money—"\n\nThe saloon-keeper's face hardened.\n\n"That's funny," he interrupted. "So do I."\n\n"I've got to have it," continued Goree, doggedly. "It's to save somebody else, not myself. I've got a gold watch there. It's worth a hundred dollars easy."\n\nBen took the watch and looked at it critically.\n\n"I'll loan you fifty on it," he said, after a close inspection.\n\n"I'll take it," said Goree, pressing his lips together. "And I want it quick. I've got to have it to-day."\n\n"You shall have it," said Ben, writing out a check for the amount. "I'll take the watch. When will you redeem it?"\n\n"I don't know," said Goree, slowly. "Maybe—never. I don't know."\n\nAfter he had received the money, Goree went straight to the bank and deposited it to his account. Then he returned to his office and wrote a check for $400. He enclosed it in a letter to Colonel Coltrane, and sent it by a messenger.\n\nThen he sat down to wait. He felt that he had done what he could to atone for the wrong he was committing. But he was not happy about it. He knew that he had only put off the evil day.\n\nThe next morning Colonel Coltrane's man came with the money for the foreclosure. Goree took it and gave him a receipt. Then he went to Mrs. Ramsey's and told her that she could remain in her home.\n\nThe widow's face was a study. Joy, incredulity, and a premonition of trouble struggled for the mastery.\n\n"Do you mean, Mr. Goree," she asked, trembling, "that I don't have to leave my home?"\n\n"You do not," said Goree. "The mortgage is lifted. You are free from debt."\n\nThe woman broke down and wept. Goree turned away his head. When she could speak, she said:\n\n"Oh, sir, how can I ever thank you? It seems like you have been sent by Providence to help me. I had lost all hope. How can I ever thank you?"\n\n"Don't try," said Goree, gruffly. "It wasn't for your sake. It was a debt I owed to—to—well, to myself. I couldn't see you turned out. I'll send somebody around to attend to the transfer of the property."\n\nWhen he left the widow's cottage, Goree went straight to the saloon. He found Ben Tatum wiping his bar.\n\n"Ben," he said, "I want to buy back that watch."\n\n"Your credit's good," said Ben, "but the watch is gone."\n\n"Gone!" exclaimed Goree, with a sinking heart.\n\n"Yes," said Ben. "I sold it last night to a man from Atlanta. He took a fancy to it, and offered me double what I gave you. I couldn't turn down a bargain like that."\n\nGoree said nothing, but walked out of the saloon. He felt that he had indeed made a bargain with fate, and had lost. But he was not sorry. He had saved the widow's home, and that was something. He could not have borne to see her turned out. He had done what he could, and he was satisfied.\n\nThat night Yancey Goree took the train for the West, with the intention of losing himself and forgetting—something he had never succeeded in doing before.	a-blackjack-bargainer	\N	2055	2025-07-20 12:15:23.027	2025-08-06 00:23:30.395	\N	1	en	1
10	A Call Loan	O. Henry	In a tale that begins with a philosophical musing on geometry and life, two friends, the narrator and Billy Winthrop, encounter a desperate woman in a dimly lit city district. After dining at the Bachelors' Club and engaging in lively discussions, they walk through a neighborhood of small shops where they meet a ragged woman who begs for help. Winthrop, moved by her plight, mistakenly gives her a ten-dollar bill instead of one. Realizing the error, he devises a plan to recover his money by tracking the bill through local shopkeepers. The scheme leads them to the woman's abode, revealing her dire circumstances and prompting a reflection on the impact of their actions, ultimately leaving the money with her as they confront the unintended consequences of their adventure.	At the hazard of wearying you this tale of vehement emotions must be prefaced by a discourse on geometry.\n\nNature moves in circles; Art in straight lines. The natural is rounded; the artificial is made up of angles. A man lost in the snow wanders, in spite of himself, in perfect circles; the city man's feet, denaturalized by rectangular streets and floors, carry him ever away from himself. The round eyes of childhood typify innocence; the narrowed line of the flirt's optic proves the invasion of art. The horizontal mouth is the mark of determined cunning; who has not read Nature's most spontaneous lyric in lips rounded for the candid kiss? Our ancestors lived in round huts and fought in the open; we square off into brick boxes, and intrigue in the heart of closets. The beasts, birds, and fishes whose guile is straightforward, and whose motion is in curves, are passing away. We are hedging them 'round with the right angle of civilization and the ninety-degree fence.\n\nBut, after all, this is an oblong story, and we must not make it too circular.\n\nSo, after this prelude, we will back to our lamb chops and mint sauce.\n\nI was to dine at the Bachelors' that evening with Billy Winthrop, and I was late. I had been to see a man about a dog, and the dog was slow in deciding. When I reached the club, Winthrop had left word that he had gone over to the St. James, and for me to follow.\n\nI found him at a table with some others of our set, and we dined hilariously and well. Afterward, we drifted into one of those discussions of things in general that begin amiably and end in smoke. At twelve o'clock, we were well fortified with reason and hoarded opinions, and Winthrop and I left the others and went out for a stroll.\n\nWe walked without choosing a way. Our course led us through a district of small shops in a neighbourhood not yet redeemed from the early disrepute of the city's first spreading. Here and there a late-working tradesman yet lingered, loath to leave his work. The streets were lighted dimly by infrequent lamps, and by the faint radiance diffused from the lighted windows of the shops.\n\nSuddenly, from a dark alley that we were passing, there sprang with a bound and a fierce cry a figure, gaunt, ragged, and terrible. With a hollow voice it cried to us for alms. I felt my ever-ready dime, that I keep for such occasions, leap and tremble in my pocket, but I restrained it. Then the figure darted from the shadow of the alley, and a stream of light from a nearby lamp fell upon it, and we saw that it was a woman.\n\nShe was young, and not without a suggestion of comeliness in her wasted form. Her hair, thick and gold, rioted beneath an old bonnet. Her eyes were wild and bright, and her face was drawn and white. She repeated her piteous cry for help, holding out a thin hand that trembled like a wind-blown leaf.\n\nBilly Winthrop is susceptible, as are all men who are worth a sou, to certain influences. Among these are bright eyes in distress, good music, burnt cork comedy, mothers' meetings, and the hoarse paging of his name in a hotel lobby. He drew out a dollar bill and pressed it into her hand. The woman seized it with a quick cry of joy that was half a sob, and then turned and fled back like a ghost into the impenetrable shadows of her alley.\n\nWinthrop and I walked on without speaking. I was wondering if the lamb chops at the Bachelors' had been as good as usual, and Winthrop was no doubt pondering on some way to evade the extra expense that his susceptible heart had brought upon him.\n\nWe had gone a little way when he suddenly stopped and exclaimed:\n\n"By George! I've made a mistake. That was a ten-dollar bill I gave that woman."\n\n"Ten dollars!" said I. "It was worth a dollar to see her wolfish snatch at it and the grin she gave us from the shadow. You'll never see it again."\n\n"I don't know about that," said Winthrop, thoughtfully. "I believe I'll get it back."\n\n"How?" I asked.\n\n"I'll advertise it," said he. "Lost, ten dollars. If the finder will return it, he can keep the change."\n\nWe laughed at Winthrop's joke, and I left him at the corner of his street and walked on to my apartment, where I found a man waiting for me with a note. It was from Winthrop, and it said:\n\n"Come back to the St. James. I've got a scheme to get my ten dollars back."\n\nI was tired, but I was younger then than now, and the word "scheme" had a lure. I went back to the St. James.\n\nWinthrop was waiting for me with his hat and coat on.\n\n"We'll get that ten back easy," he said, confidently, as we left the hotel. "I've been thinking it over. Here's the plan: We know about where she lives. She'll be sure to have that bill changed tomorrow. Now, we can get next to all the shopkeepers in that neighbourhood and explain. They'll all know that bill. They'll call us up when it's presented, and we'll go around and talk to the lady."\n\nI was doubtful, but Winthrop's enthusiasm was contagious, and we started out on his wild-goose chase. We visited every shop in the neighbourhood and explained our scheme to the shopkeepers. They all agreed to notify us when the bill was presented.\n\nThe next day I received a message at my office that the bill had been passed at a grocery store. I hurried to the place. Winthrop was already there, talking to the grocer.\n\nThe grocer told us that the bill had been given to him by a young woman who had bought fifty cents' worth of sausage. He described her so accurately that we knew it was our quarry.\n\nWe hurried to the address he had given us. It was the same dark alley from which the woman had emerged the night before. We found her in a wretched room, ill and despairing. The room was bare and cold, and in one corner was a mattress on the floor where lay a man, ill and moaning. The woman had bought the sausage for him.\n\nWinthrop's heart was touched. He forgot his ten dollars. He put his hand in his pocket, and I knew that he was fingering bills. But I caught his arm.\n\n"Come away," I said. "This is no place for comedy. Your ten dollars has brought enough tragedy already."\n\nWe went away silently, and left the ten to its fate.	\N	\N	1138	2025-07-20 12:15:53.443	2025-08-11 10:03:04.893	\N	1	en	1
5	The Gift of the Magi	O. Henry	In 'The Gift of the Magi,' a young couple, Della and Jim Young, grapple with financial hardship in their modest flat as Christmas approaches. Della, determined to buy a special gift for Jim, sells her prized long hair to afford a platinum fob chain for Jim's cherished heirloom watch. Unbeknownst to her, Jim faces his own sacrifice to secure a gift for Della. The story unfolds in a modest urban setting, capturing themes of love, sacrifice, and the irony of giving.	The Gift of the Magi\n\nOne dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And sixty cents of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one's cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas.\n\nThere was clearly nothing to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and howl. So Della did it. Which instigates the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles predominating.\n\nWhile the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first stage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished flat at $8 per week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had that word on the lookout for the mendicancy squad.\n\nIn the vestibule below was a letter-box into which no letter would go, and an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring. Also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name "Mr. James Dillingham Young."\n\nThe "Dillingham" had been flung to the breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid $30 per week. Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, the letters of "Dillingham" looked blurred, as though they were thinking seriously of contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James Dillingham Young came home and reached his flat above he was called "Jim" and greatly hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as Della. Which is all very good.\n\nDella finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag. She stood by the window and looked out dully at a grey cat walking a grey fence in a grey backyard. Tomorrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present. She had been saving every penny she could for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn't go far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. They always are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him. Something fine and rare and sterling—something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honour of being owned by Jim.\n\nThere was a pier-glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you have seen a pier-glass in an $8 flat. A very thin and very agile person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks. Della, being slender, had mastered the art.\n\nSuddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its colour within twenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length.\n\nNow, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which they both took a mighty pride. One was Jim's gold watch that had been his father's and his grandfather's. The other was Della's hair. Had the Queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty's jewels and gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy.\n\nSo now Della's beautiful hair fell about her rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her. And then she did it up again nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet.\n\nOn went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat. With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she fluttered out the door and down the stairs to the street.\n\nWhere she stopped the sign read: "Mme. Sofronie. Hair Goods of All Kinds." One flight up Della ran, and collected herself, panting. Madame, large, too white, chilly, hardly looked the "Sofronie."\n\n"Will you buy my hair?" asked Della.\n\n"I buy hair," said Madame. "Take yer hat off and let's have a sight at the looks of it."\n\nDown rippled the brown cascade.\n\n"Twenty dollars," said Madame, lifting the mass with a practised hand.\n\n"Give it to me quick," said Della.\n\nOh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget the hashed metaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim's present.\n\nShe found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else. There was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had turned all of them inside out. It was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation—as all good things should do. It was even worthy of The Watch. As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be Jim's. It was like him. Quietness and value—the description applied to both. Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried home with the 87 cents. With that chain on his watch Jim might be properly anxious about the time in any company. Grand as the watch was, he sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in place of a chain.\n\nWhen Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence and reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love. Which is always a tremendous task, dear friends—a mammoth task.\n\nWithin forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. She looked at her reflection in the mirror long, carefully, and critically.\n\n"If Jim doesn't kill me," she said to herself, "before he takes a second look at me, he'll say I look like a Coney Island chorus girl. But what could I do—oh! what could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven cents?"\n\nAt 7 o'clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chops.\n\nJim was never late. Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the table near the door that he always entered. Then she heard his step on the stair away down on the first flight, and she turned white for just a moment. She had a habit for saying little silent prayers about the simplest everyday things, and now she whispered: "Please God, make him think I am still pretty."\n\nThe door opened and Jim stepped in and closed it. He looked thin and very serious. Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two—and to be burdened with a family! He needed a new overcoat and he was without gloves.\n\nJim stopped inside the door, as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail. His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there was an expression in them that she could not read, and it terrified her. It was not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the sentiments that she had been prepared for. He simply stared at her fixedly with that peculiar expression on his face.\n\nDella wriggled off the table and went for him.\n\n"Jim, darling," she cried, "don't look at me that way. I had my hair cut off and sold because I couldn't have lived through Christmas without giving you a present. It'll grow out again—you won't mind, will you? I just had to do it. My hair grows awfully fast. Say 'Merry Christmas!' Jim, and let's be happy. You don't know what a nice—what a beautiful, nice gift I've got for you."\n\n"You've cut off your hair?" asked Jim, laboriously, as if he had not arrived at that patent fact yet even after the hardest mental labour.\n\n"Cut it off and sold it," said Della. "Don't you like me just as well, anyhow? I'm me without my hair, ain't I?"\n\nJim looked about the room curiously.\n\n"You say your hair is gone?" he said, with an air almost of idiocy.\n\n"You needn't look for it," said Della. "It's sold, I tell you—sold and gone, too. It's Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it went for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were numbered," she went on with sudden serious sweetness, "but nobody could ever count my love for you. Shall I put the chops on, Jim?"\n\nOut of his trance Jim seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded his Della. For ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction. Eight dollars a week or a million a year—what is the difference? A mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer. The magi brought valuable gifts, but that was not among them. This dark assertion will be illuminated later on.\n\nJim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the table.\n\n"Don't make any mistake, Dell," he said, "about me. I don't think there's anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that could make me like my girl any less. But if you'll unwrap that package you may see why you had me going a while at first."\n\nWhite fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper. And then an ecstatic scream of joy; and then, alas! A quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails, necessitating the immediate employment of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat.\n\nFor there lay The Combs—the set of combs, side and back, that Della had worshipped for long in a Broadway window. Beautiful combs, pure tortoise shell, with jewelled rims—just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They were expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of possession. And now, they were hers, but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone.\n\nBut she hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say: "My hair grows so fast, Jim!"\n\nAnd then Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried, "Oh, oh!"\n\nJim had not yet seen his beautiful present. She held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm. The dull precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit.\n\n"Isn't it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it. You'll have to look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give me your watch. I want to see how it looks on it."\n\nInstead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands under the back of his head and smiled.\n\n"Dell," said he, "let's put our Christmas presents away and keep 'em a while. They're too nice to use just at present. I sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs. And now suppose you put the chops on."\n\nThe magi, as you know, were wise men—wonderfully wise men—who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger. They invented the art of giving Christmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication. And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest. Of all who give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest. Everywhere they are wisest. They are the magi.	\N	\N	2067	2025-07-20 11:52:08.471	2025-08-07 10:42:53.871	\N	1	en	1
14	After Twenty Years	O. Henry	In New York, a man named Bob returns after twenty years to fulfill a pact made with his best friend, Jimmy Wells, to meet at the location of their last dinner together before Bob left to seek fortune in the West. Waiting at the now-demolished 'Big Joe' Brady's restaurant, Bob encounters a policeman while reminiscing about his past and the promise. As the story unfolds, Bob meets someone he believes to be Jimmy, but the reunion takes an unexpected turn when the true identity and intentions of the newcomer are revealed, leading to a surprising twist involving law enforcement.	The policeman on the beat moved up the avenue impressively. The impressiveness was habitual and not for show, for spectators were few. The time was barely 10 o'clock at night, but chilly gusts of wind with a taste of rain in them had well nigh depeopled the streets.\n\nTrying doors as he went, twirling his club with many intricate and artful movements, turning now and then to cast his watchful eye adown the pacific thoroughfare, the officer, with his stalwart form and slight swagger, made a fine picture of a guardian of the peace. The vicinity was one that kept early hours. Now and then you might see the lights of a cigar store or of an all-night lunch counter; but the majority of the doors belonged to business places that had long since been closed.\n\nWhen about midway of a certain block the policeman suddenly slowed his pace. In the doorway of a darkened hardware store a man leaned, with an unlighted cigar in his mouth. As the officer walked up to him the man spoke up quickly.\n\n"It's all right, officer," he said, reassuringly. "I'm just waiting for a friend. It's an appointment made twenty years ago. Sounds a little funny to you, doesn't it? Well, I'll explain if you'd like to make certain it's all straight. About that long ago there used to be a restaurant where this store stands—'Big Joe' Brady's restaurant."\n\n"Until five years ago," said the policeman. "It was torn down then."\n\nThe man in the doorway struck a match and lit his cigar. The light showed a pale, square-jawed face with keen eyes, and a little white scar near his right eyebrow. His scarf-pin was a large diamond, oddly set.\n\n"Twenty years ago to-night," said the man, "I dined here at 'Big Joe' Brady's with Jimmy Wells, my best chum, and the finest chap in the world. He and I were raised here in New York, just like two brothers together. I was eighteen and Jimmy was twenty. The next morning I was to start for the West to make my fortune. You couldn't have dragged Jimmy out of New York; he thought it was the only place on earth. Well, we agreed that night that we'd meet here again exactly twenty years from that date and time, no matter what our conditions might be or from what distance we might have to come. We figured that in twenty years each of us ought to have our destiny worked out and our fortunes made, whatever they were going to be."\n\n"It sounds pretty interesting," said the policeman. "Rather a long time to wait for a dinner, though."\n\n"It's been twenty years," the man explained, with a touch of pride in his voice. "I've come a thousand miles to stand in this door to-night, and it's worth it if my old partner turns up."\n\nThe policeman twirled his club and took a step or two.\n\n"I'll wait a little longer," said the man. "He might turn up yet."\n\n"Have you heard from him since?" asked the policeman.\n\n"No," said the man. "The West is a pretty big proposition, and I've been hustling around over it pretty lively. But I know Jimmy will meet me here if he's alive, for he always was the truest, staunchest old chap in the world. He'd never forget. I came a thousand miles to stand here to-night, and I'm going to give him half an hour more."\n\n"He was the kind of man who is bound to turn up," said the policeman, slowly.\n\n"Right you are," said the man in the doorway. "I'll wait a bit longer. I'm not hungry. It's more the meeting than the eating."\n\nThe policeman moved up the street, twirling his club, stopping now and then to watch the lonely figure in the doorway. The man pulled out a handsome watch, the lids of it set with small diamonds.\n\n"Three minutes to ten," he announced. "It was exactly ten o'clock when we parted here at the restaurant door."\n\n"Did pretty well out West, didn't you?" asked the policeman.\n\n"You bet! I hope Jimmy has done half as well. He was a kind of plodder, though, good fellow as he was. I've had to compete with some of the sharpest wits going to get my pile. A man gets in a groove in New York. It takes the West to put a razor-edge on him."\n\nThe policeman twirled his club and took a few steps down the street.\n\n"I'll be on my way. Hope your friend comes around all right. Going to call time on him sharp?"\n\n"I should say not!" said the other. "I'll give him half an hour at least. If Jimmy is alive on earth he'll be here by that time. So long, officer."\n\n"Good-night, sir," said the policeman, starting down the street.\n\nThe man in the doorway lighted another cigar and leaned against the frame of the door.\n\nTwenty minutes passed. A tall man in a long overcoat, with collar turned up to his ears, hurried across from the opposite side of the street. He went directly to the waiting man.\n\n"Is that you, Bob?" he asked, doubtfully.\n\n"Is that you, Jimmy Wells?" cried the man in the door.\n\n"Bless my heart!" exclaimed the new arrival, grasping both the other's hands with his own. "It's Bob, sure as fate. I was certain I'd find you here if you were still in existence. Well, well, well!—twenty years is a long time. The old restaurant's gone, Bob; I wish it were here so we could have another dinner in it. Has the West treated you well?"\n\n"Better than I deserve, old man," returned the other. "I've got to hustle back there right away after we've had our talk. I was lucky enough to strike some rich pay dirt out there. I've brought a little roll in my pocket to keep me till I get back to the diggings. I'm mighty glad to see you, Jimmy."\n\n"It's been a long time, and I'm glad too, Bob. You've changed lots more than I thought you would, though. Are you going to stay East?"\n\n"No. I'm going back in a week. I just had to see you first, though. It's been eating me up all these years, not knowing how you were making out."\n\n"All right, Bob. I guess we'd better be going up to the square and have a talk over old times."\n\nThe two men started up the street, arm in arm. The man from the West, his egotism enlarged by success, was beginning to outline the history of his career. The other, submerged in his overcoat, listened with interest.\n\nAt the corner stood a drug store, brilliant with electric lights. When they came into this glare each of them turned simultaneously to gaze upon the other's face.\n\nThe man from the West stopped suddenly and released his arm.\n\n"You're not Jimmy Wells," he snapped.\n\n"Twenty years is a long time," said the tall man, coolly. "It sometimes changes a good man into a bad one. You've been under arrest for ten minutes, 'Silky' Bob. Chicago thinks you may have dropped over our way and wires us she wants to have a chat with you. Going quietly, are you? That's sensible. Now, before we go on to the station here's a note I was asked to hand you. You may read it here at the light. It's from Patrolman Wells."\n\nThe man from the West unfolded the little piece of paper handed him. His hand was steady when he began to read, but it trembled a little by the time he had finished. The note was rather short.\n\n"Bob: I was at the appointed place on time. When you struck the match to light your cigar I saw it was the face of the man wanted in Chicago. Somehow I couldn't do it myself, so I went around and got a plain clothes man to do the job. JIMMY."	\N	\N	1334	2025-07-20 13:29:34.379	2025-08-06 11:43:27.482	\N	1	en	\N
15	A Comedy in Rubber	O. Henry	In O. Henry's classic story, set in a modest urban apartment, Della Young struggles with financial hardship as she attempts to buy a Christmas gift for her beloved husband, Jim. With only $1.87 saved from scrimping on household expenses, Della decides to sell her most prized possession, her long, beautiful hair, to afford a platinum fob chain for Jim's treasured heirloom watch. Unbeknownst to her, Jim faces his own dilemma in securing a gift for Della, leading to a poignant twist that underscores their mutual sacrifice and deep love.	One dollar and eighty-seven cents. That was all. And sixty cents of it was in pennies. Pennies saved one and two at a time by bulldozing the grocer and the vegetable man and the butcher until one's cheeks burned with the silent imputation of parsimony that such close dealing implied. Three times Della counted it. One dollar and eighty-seven cents. And the next day would be Christmas.\n\nThere was clearly nothing to do but flop down on the shabby little couch and howl. So Della did it. Which instigates the moral reflection that life is made up of sobs, sniffles, and smiles, with sniffles predominating.\n\nWhile the mistress of the home is gradually subsiding from the first stage to the second, take a look at the home. A furnished flat at $8 per week. It did not exactly beggar description, but it certainly had that word on the lookout for the mendicancy squad.\n\nIn the vestibule below was a letter-box into which no letter would go, and an electric button from which no mortal finger could coax a ring. Also appertaining thereunto was a card bearing the name "Mr. James Dillingham Young."\n\nThe "Dillingham" had been flung to the breeze during a former period of prosperity when its possessor was being paid $30 per week. Now, when the income was shrunk to $20, though, they were thinking seriously of contracting to a modest and unassuming D. But whenever Mr. James Dillingham Young came home and reached his flat above he was called "Jim" and greatly hugged by Mrs. James Dillingham Young, already introduced to you as Della. Which is all very good.\n\nDella finished her cry and attended to her cheeks with the powder rag. She stood by the window and looked out dully at a gray cat walking a gray fence in a gray backyard. Tomorrow would be Christmas Day, and she had only $1.87 with which to buy Jim a present. She had been saving every penny she could for months, with this result. Twenty dollars a week doesn't go far. Expenses had been greater than she had calculated. They always are. Only $1.87 to buy a present for Jim. Her Jim. Many a happy hour she had spent planning for something nice for him. Something fine and rare and sterling—something just a little bit near to being worthy of the honor of being owned by Jim.\n\nThere was a pier glass between the windows of the room. Perhaps you have seen a pier glass in an $8 flat. A very thin and very agile person may, by observing his reflection in a rapid sequence of longitudinal strips, obtain a fairly accurate conception of his looks. Della, being slender, had mastered the art.\n\nSuddenly she whirled from the window and stood before the glass. Her eyes were shining brilliantly, but her face had lost its color within twenty seconds. Rapidly she pulled down her hair and let it fall to its full length.\n\nNow, there were two possessions of the James Dillingham Youngs in which they both took a mighty pride. One was Jim's gold watch that had been his father's and his grandfather's. The other was Della's hair. Had the queen of Sheba lived in the flat across the airshaft, Della would have let her hair hang out the window some day to dry just to depreciate Her Majesty's jewels and gifts. Had King Solomon been the janitor, with all his treasures piled up in the basement, Jim would have pulled out his watch every time he passed, just to see him pluck at his beard from envy.\n\nSo now Della's beautiful hair fell about her, rippling and shining like a cascade of brown waters. It reached below her knee and made itself almost a garment for her. And then she did it up again nervously and quickly. Once she faltered for a minute and stood still while a tear or two splashed on the worn red carpet.\n\nOn went her old brown jacket; on went her old brown hat. With a whirl of skirts and with the brilliant sparkle still in her eyes, she fluttered out the door and down the stairs to the street.\n\nWhere she stopped the sign read: "Mme. Sofronie. Hair Goods of All Kinds." One flight up Della ran, and collected herself, panting. Madame, large, too white, chilly, hardly looked the "Sofronie."\n\n"Will you buy my hair?" asked Della.\n\n"I buy hair," said Madame. "Take yer hat off and let's have a sight at the looks of it."\n\nDown rippled the brown cascade.\n\n"Twenty dollars," said Madame, lifting the mass with a practiced hand.\n\n"Give it to me quick," said Della.\n\nOh, and the next two hours tripped by on rosy wings. Forget the hashed metaphor. She was ransacking the stores for Jim's present.\n\nShe found it at last. It surely had been made for Jim and no one else. There was no other like it in any of the stores, and she had turned all of them inside out. It was a platinum fob chain simple and chaste in design, properly proclaiming its value by substance alone and not by meretricious ornamentation—as all good things should do. And it was even worthy of The Watch. As soon as she saw it she knew that it must be Jim's. It was like him. Quietness and value—the description applied to both. Twenty-one dollars they took from her for it, and she hurried home with the 87 cents. With that chain on his watch Jim might be properly anxious about the time in any company. Grand as the watch was, he sometimes looked at it on the sly on account of the old leather strap that he used in place of a chain.\n\nWhen Della reached home her intoxication gave way a little to prudence and reason. She got out her curling irons and lighted the gas and went to work repairing the ravages made by generosity added to love. Which is always a tremendous task, dear friends—a mammoth task.\n\nWithin forty minutes her head was covered with tiny, close-lying curls that made her look wonderfully like a truant schoolboy. She looked at her reflection in the mirror long, carefully, and critically.\n\n"If Jim doesn't kill me," she said to herself, "before he takes a second look at me, he'll say I look like a Coney Island chorus girl. But what could I do—oh! what could I do with a dollar and eighty-seven cents?"\n\nAt 7 o'clock the coffee was made and the frying-pan was on the back of the stove hot and ready to cook the chops.\n\nJim was never late. Della doubled the fob chain in her hand and sat on the corner of the table near the door that he always entered. Then she heard his step on the stair away down on the first flight, and she turned white for just a moment. She had a habit of saying little silent prayers about the simplest everyday things, and now she prayed that he be still okay and not too thin.\n\nHe opened the door and came in. He looked thin and very serious. Poor fellow, he was only twenty-two—and to be burdened with a family! He needed a new overcoat and was without gloves.\n\nJim stopped inside the door, as immovable as a setter at the scent of quail. His eyes were fixed upon Della, and there was an expression in them that she could not read, and it terrified her. It was not anger, nor surprise, nor disapproval, nor horror, nor any of the sentiments that she had been prepared for. He simply stared at her fixedly with that peculiar expression on his face.\n\nDella wriggled off the table and went for him.\n\n"Jim, darling," she cried, "don't look at me that way. I had my hair cut off and sold because I couldn't have lived through Christmas without giving you a present. It'll grow out again—you won't mind, will you? I just had to do it. My hair grows awfully fast. Say 'Merry Christmas!' Jim, and let's be happy. You don't know what a nice—what a beautiful, nice gift I've got for you."\n\n"You've cut off your hair?" asked Jim, laboriously, as if he had not arrived at that patent fact yet even after the hardest mental labor.\n\n"Cut it off and sold it," said Della. "Don't you like me just as well, anyhow? I'm me without my hair, ain't I?"\n\nJim looked about the room curiously.\n\n"You say your hair is gone?" he said, with an air almost of idiocy.\n\n"You needn't look for it," said Della. "It's sold, I tell you—sold and gone, too. It's Christmas Eve, boy. Be good to me, for it went for you. Maybe the hairs of my head were numbered," she went on with sudden serious sweetness, "but nobody could ever count my love for you. Shall I put the chops on, Jim?"\n\nOut of his trance Jim seemed quickly to wake. He enfolded his Della. For ten seconds let us regard with discreet scrutiny some inconsequential object in the other direction. Eight dollars a week or a million a year—what is the difference? A mathematician or a wit would give you the wrong answer. The magi brought valuable gifts, but that was not among them. This dark assertion will be illuminated later on.\n\nJim drew a package from his overcoat pocket and threw it upon the table.\n\n"Don't make any mistake, Dell," he said, "about me. I don't think there's anything in the way of a haircut or a shave or a shampoo that could make me like my girl any less. But if you'll unwrap that package you may see why you had me going a while at first."\n\nWhite fingers and nimble tore at the string and paper. And then an ecstatic scream of joy; and then, alas! a quick feminine change to hysterical tears and wails, necessitating the immediate employment of all the comforting powers of the lord of the flat.\n\nFor there lay The Combs—the set of combs, side and back, that Della had worshipped long in a Broadway window. Beautiful combs, pure tortoise shell, with jeweled rims—just the shade to wear in the beautiful vanished hair. They were expensive combs, she knew, and her heart had simply craved and yearned over them without the least hope of possession. And now, they were hers, but the tresses that should have adorned the coveted adornments were gone.\n\nBut she hugged them to her bosom, and at length she was able to look up with dim eyes and a smile and say: "My hair grows so fast, Jim!"\n\nAnd then Della leaped up like a little singed cat and cried, "Oh, oh!"\n\nJim had not yet seen his beautiful present. She held it out to him eagerly upon her open palm. The dull precious metal seemed to flash with a reflection of her bright and ardent spirit.\n\n"Isn't it a dandy, Jim? I hunted all over town to find it. You'll have to look at the time a hundred times a day now. Give me your watch. I want to see how it looks on it."\n\nInstead of obeying, Jim tumbled down on the couch and put his hands under the back of his head and smiled.\n\n"Dell," said he, "let's put our Christmas presents away and keep 'em a while. They're too nice to use just at present. I sold the watch to get the money to buy your combs. And now suppose you put the chops on."\n\nThe magi, as you know, were wise men—wonderfully wise men—who brought gifts to the Babe in the manger. They invented the art of giving Christmas presents. Being wise, their gifts were no doubt wise ones, possibly bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication. And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two were the wisest. O all who give and receive gifts, such as they are wisest. Everywhere they are wisest. They are the magi.	\N	\N	2053	2025-07-20 13:35:34.673	2025-08-06 11:54:57.602	\N	1	en	\N
12	A Chaparral Prince	O. Henry	A young Eastern man named Harris arrives in Cactus, Texas, dressed in new clothes and seeking a man named Elias Summers regarding a land purchase. Guided by a stage driver, Harris reaches the Summers residence where he meets Elias and his son Jim. Expressing interest in buying a ranch, Harris is taken by Jim to see the land, decides to purchase it, and becomes a successful ranchman after settling his affairs back East. The story highlights Harris's transition from a newcomer to a well-established member of the Texas ranching community.	The only passenger on the stage that drew up before the stage-office at Cactus, Texas, was a young man in a brand-new suit of store clothes. He was tall and slender, and his face was smooth and pink. He wore a broad-brimmed, low-crowned felt hat, and carried a solid gold-headed cane. He looked like a college senior who had just stepped out from a class-day procession.\n\nThe only other person who alighted from the stage was its driver, who threw off the mail-sack and then climbed down to the ground to water his horses.\n\nThe young man in the new clothes walked up to the driver.\n\n"Can you tell me, sir," he said, with a Northern accent, "if there is a man living here named Summers—Mr. Elias Summers?"\n\nThe stage-driver was watering his horses. He stopped and looked up.\n\n"Summers?" he repeated. "Yes, sir. Old man Summers lives about four miles out on the Silver City road. I'm going right by his place now. I can take you out there if you want to go."\n\n"Thank you," said the young man. "I'll be glad to ride out with you."\n\nHe climbed into the stage, and the driver got up on his seat and shook the reins. The horses started off at a slow trot.\n\nThe young man seemed to be interested in the scenery. He looked out of the window at the mesquite bushes and cactus plants that lined the road. He was evidently unused to the country.\n\nAfter they had gone about three miles, the driver pointed with his whip to a house that stood in a grove of live oaks about a quarter of a mile from the road.\n\n"That's old man Summers's place," he said. "I'll let you out at the next turn, and you can walk over. It's not far."\n\n"Thank you," said the young man. He got out when the stage stopped, and walked in the direction indicated.\n\nOld man Summers was sitting on the porch of his house when the young man opened the gate and walked up the path. He was a tall, lean old man, with a long white beard and sharp blue eyes. He looked up as the young man approached.\n\n"Good-morning, sir," said the young man, lifting his hat. "Are you Mr. Summers?"\n\n"That's my name," said the old man. "What can I do for you?"\n\n"My name is Harris," said the young man. "I am from the East. I have come out here to look at some land with a view to buying it."\n\n"Sit down," said old man Summers, pointing to a chair. "I'll call my son Jim. He's the one you want to see about land. He knows all about it."\n\nHe went into the house, and soon returned with a young man about the same age as Harris. Jim Summers was tall and thin, like his father, but his face was brown and his hands were rough. He looked like a man who had worked hard.\n\n"How do you do, sir?" he said, shaking hands with Harris. "I understand you are looking for land. What kind of land do you want?"\n\n"I want to buy a ranch," said Harris. "I have some capital to invest, and I think I would like to go into the cattle business."\n\nJim Summers looked at him with a smile.\n\n"You're from the East, aren't you?" he said.\n\n"Yes," said Harris.\n\n"Well," said Jim, "I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll take you out and show you some land that I think will suit you. But I must warn you that ranching is not all play. It's hard work."\n\n"I'm not afraid of work," said Harris.\n\n"All right," said Jim. "We'll start to-morrow morning. You can stay here to-night if you like."\n\n"Thank you," said Harris. "I'll be glad to."\n\nHe stayed at the Summers's house that night, and the next morning he and Jim rode out to look at the land. They were gone all day, and when they returned Harris had decided to buy the ranch.\n\n"I'll take it," he said to Jim, as they rode up to the house.\n\n"All right," said Jim. "I'll have the papers made out and we'll close the deal to-morrow."\n\nThe next day the papers were signed and Harris became the owner of a ranch in Texas. He was very much pleased with his purchase, and he and Jim Summers became good friends.\n\nHarris went back to the East to settle up his business affairs, and then returned to Texas to take charge of his ranch. He found that ranching was indeed hard work, but he was young and strong and he liked the life. He prospered and in a few years he was one of the successful ranchmen of the region.\n\nAnd he always said that it was the best thing he had ever done to come out to Texas and buy that ranch from Jim Summers.	\N	\N	838	2025-07-20 13:02:57.459	2025-08-06 08:22:05.542	\N	1	en	\N
